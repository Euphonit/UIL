### Notes
## Good today but REALLY needs improving on alot of fronts to win superior at UIL
autumn at the beginning you need more emotion
reshad and keyante stop joking around backstage and be ready
BE LOUDER ON BERKNER STAGE
get off book soon everyone 2 days until off book
remeber to move stools in page 22 foxy
get laughs down their really awkward
Foxy get pronuciation down more, it's mostly good but there are sometimes where you stop and think a second, it just interrupts the flow
Ms. Gardiner was SO good
Reshad you could be more dramatic in some scenes
PAGE 24 was great it really felt like the stress and tension of the situation was there
foxy despite all the little pronuciation stuff you did really well on page 25
"Mr. Darcy!" P. 25 was good the suprise and the emotions were good
Fitzwilliam during both of your scenes it is hard to hear you and need to enunciate more
Mr. Wickham is REALLY REALLY good with the pronuciation and the accent it's very good
Keyante you missed your entrance on 28 horrible, even after ms muir said it you were so slow
Then you lost the energy keyante we cant have that happening on the show
after "Lizzy!" bella there was a bit of a kerfufle in your words make sure you really hone in on that part
Reshad STOP MESSING AROUND even on stage
Need more energy in final conversation reshad and ava
Reshad & Ava your faces need more emotion during final conversion
Hunter in beggining you should be a tad more lively, your a little to monotone, maybe have seem like more insulted when saying "My Dear, I have high respect for your nerves. They are my old freinds"
## AfterSchool Rehearsal
Autumn get on those lines
Autumn be loud but dont be crazy
Ava stop complaining about the gloves in the middle of the run, do it after (Page 8)
Reshad stop making funny faces (Page 8 & 9)
add more pause during "I feel like a bull in a china shop", more inquisitive "I feel like a, (pause) bull in a china shop"
Nhoa I love the accent just be a bit more confident and powerful, act like your a villian and you KNOW you are
